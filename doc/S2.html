Such a page must be explicitly <span style="" class="text italic">unpinned</span> when the client is done

from a client, they are brought to the buffer pool. If a page is already

(the maximum number is determined by <span style="" class="text typewriter">BF_MAX_BUFS</span>),
then a page must be chosen as victim from the LRU list.
Its content has to be written back to disk (in case it is <span style="" class="text italic">dirty</span>)
and then the buffer entry would be reused for the page to be read.
The victim page is chosen by going backward from
the last (<span style="" class="text italic">i.e.</span>, least recently used) buffer page.
The allocated page is put at the beginning of the buffer.
If all the pages in the LRU list are pinned and the list has the maximum
number of pages allowed, then an error condition must be returned.

This memory block stores a file page associated with a PF file descriptor

If the buffer page is already in the buffer pool,

<div class="para" id="SS3.SSS1.p1"><p class="p">Note that unpinning a page does not necessarily cause the page to be
removed from the buffer;
an unpinned page is kept in memory as long as its space
in the buffer pool is not needed.

<div class="para" id="SS3.SSS2.p1"><p class="p">In each function, incoming parameters should be checked for validity
before doing anything. If an error is detected, an error code should be
returned to the calling function.
Ideally, it should not be possible for a caller to crash the BF layer
(or any lower layer) by passing incorrect arguments to an BF layer function.
In addition to validating parameters on entry, you should check all
return codes to verify that no errors have occurred in a lower layer.
If an internal error (an error in a certain layer or one caused by it
but detected elsewhere) is found, then you should return right away with
an error code.</p></div>
<div class="para" id="SS3.SSS2.p2">
<p class="p">It is a good idea to have a different error code for each different
kind of error. A list of presumptive error codes is provided for each layer

Below are a few example error codes defined for the BF layer.</p>
<blockquote class="quote"><pre class="verbatim">

<p class="p">Obviously this list of error codes is not meant to be comprehensive.
Except for a few documented clearly in the function specifications,
you can choose to use or not to use any of the error codes.
Besides, it will be also a good idea to have a function
(like <span style="" class="text typewriter">BF_PrintError(int errcode)</span>) that decodes an error code
and prints a human-readable error message for convenience.</p>
